Test 1 of 1: Kernel log error check.
FAILED [HIGH] KlogENERGYPERFBIASSetToNormalWas: Test 1, HIGH Kernel message: [ 0.000238]
ENERGY_PERF_BIAS: Set to 'normal', was 'performance'

ADVICE: The MSR_IA32_ENERGY_PERF_BIAS was initialized incorrectly and was defaulted to a high
performance bias setting. The kernel has detected this and changed it down to a 'normal' bias
setting. The BIOS vendor should be informed that the MSR is not defaulted to the normal bias
setting.

Kernel message: [ 0.531647] [Firmware Bug]: ACPI: BIOS _OSI(Linux) query ignored

ADVICE: This is not exactly a failure mode but a warning from the kernel. The _OSI() method has
implemented a match to the 'Linux' query in the DSDT and this is redundant because the ACPI driver
matches onto the Windows _OSI strings by default.

FAILED [HIGH] KlogOSCInvalidUUID: Test 1, HIGH Kernel message: [ 0.632185] \_SB_.PCI0:_OSC invalid
UUID
Message repeated 2 times.

ADVICE: The _OSC method indicates it has been passed an invalid UUID, see section 6.2.10 _OSC
(Operating System Capabilities) of the ACPI specification for more details. Note that it has been
observed on some systems that this error is returned because the _OSC has evaluated incorrectly and
it returns with an incorrect error setting the OSC invalid UUID error bit.

FAILED [CRITICAL] KlogPciACPIOSCRequestFailedreturned: Test 1, CRITICAL Kernel message: [ 0.655862]
pci0000:00: ACPI _OSC request failed (AE_ERROR), returned control mask: 0x1d

ADVICE: The _OSC method evaluation failed, which will result in disabling PCIe functionality, for
example, the Linux kernel has to disable Active State Power Management (ASPM) which means that PCIe
power management is not optimally configured.

FAILED [HIGH] KlogACPIWarningReturnTypeMismatch: Test 1, HIGH Kernel message: [ 25.598589] ACPI
Warning: For \_SB_.PCI0.PEG0.PEGP._DOD: Return type mismatch - found Integer, expected Package
(20110623/nspredef-1060)

ADVICE: The ACPI Method returned an incorrect type, this should be fixed.

FAILED [HIGH] KlogACPIErrorCurrentBrightnessInvalid: Test 1, HIGH Kernel message: [ 25.604371] ACPI
Error: Current brightness invalid (20110623/video-384)
Message repeated 1 times.

ADVICE: ACPI video driver has encountered a brightness level that is outside the expected range.

Test 1 of 1: Check firmware settings MaxReadReq for PCI Express devices.
MaxReadReq for pci://00:00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family
High Definition Audio Controller (rev 05) is low (128) [Audio device].
FAILED [LOW] LowMaxReadReq: Test 1, 1 devices have low MaxReadReq settings. Firmware may have
configured these too low.

ADVICE: The MaxReadRequest size is set too low and will affect performance. It will provide
excellent bus sharing at the cost of bus data transfer rates. Although not a critical issue, it may
be worth considering setting the MaxReadRequest size to 256 or 512 to increase throughput on the PCI
Express bus. Some drivers (for example the Brocade Fibre Channel driver) allow one to override the
firmware settings. Where possible, this BIOS configuration setting is worth increasing it a little
more for better performance at a small reduction of bus sharing.

Check PCI host bridge configuration using _CRS.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test 1 of 1: Check PCI host bridge configuration using _CRS.
PASSED: Test 1, The kernel has detected a BIOS newer than the end of 2007 (9/22/2011) and has
assumed that your BIOS can correctly specify the host bridge MMIO aperture using _CRS. If this does
not work correctly you can override this by booting with "pci=nocrs".

PCIe ASPM check.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test 1 of 2: PCIe ASPM ACPI test.
No valid FACP information present: cannot test aspm.

Test 2 of 2: PCIe ASPM registers test.
WARNING: Test 2, RP 00h:01h.00h L0s not enabled.
WARNING: Test 2, Device 01h:00h.00h L0s not enabled.
PASSED: Test 2, PCIE aspm setting matched was matched.
PASSED: Test 2, PCIE aspm setting matched was matched.
WARNING: Test 2, RP 00h:1Ch.03h L0s not enabled.
FAILED [MEDIUM] PCIEASPM_UNMATCHED: Test 2, PCIE aspm setting was not matched.
RP 00h:1Ch.03h has aspm = 02h.
Device 04h:00h.00h has aspm = 03h.

ADVICE: ASPM control registers between root port and device must match in order for ASPM to be
active. Unmatched configuration indicates software did not configure ASPM correctly and the system
is not saving power at its full potential.

HPET configuration test.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test 1 of 3: Check HPET base in kernel log.
This test checks the HPET PCI BAR for each timer block in the timer. The base address is passed by
the firmware via an ACPI table. IRQ routing and initialization is also verified by the test.
PASSED: Test 1, Found HPET base fed00000 in kernel log.

Test 2 of 3: Sanity check HPET configuration.
PASSED: Test 2, Vendor ID looks sane: 8086.
PASSED: Test 2, Valid clock period 69841279.

Test 3 of 3: Check HPET base in DSDT and/or SSDT.

Test 2 of 2: Load system, check CPU fan status.
Test how many fans there are in the system. Check for the current status of the fan(s).
Loading CPUs for 20 seconds to try and get fan speeds to change.
Fan cooling_device0 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were busy.
Fan cooling_device1 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were busy.
Fan cooling_device2 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were busy.
Fan cooling_device3 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were busy.

ADVICE: Did not detect any change in the CPU related thermal cooling device states. It could be that
the devices are returning static information back to the driver and/or the fan speed is
automatically being controlled by firmware using System Management Mode in which case the kernel
interfaces being examined may not work anyway.
